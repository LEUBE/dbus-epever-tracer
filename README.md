# Epever Venus Driver
This project integrates the Epver Solarcharger with Victron Venus OS. The software runs on the Venus OS device as a Venus driver and uses the Venus dbus to read/write data for use with the Venus device.

Tested with RPi 3B - v2.91 Build 20220925213117
### Install

The provided install.sh script will copy files download dependencies and should provide a running configuration. It will not setup valid configuration values so don't expect this to be plug and play:

1. enable root access on your Venus device
2. from root login on the venus root home directory
3. run
```
wget https://github.com/kassl-2007/dbus-epever-tracer/raw/master/install.sh
```
4. run 
```
chmod +x install.sh
```
5. run
```
./install.sh
```
6. answer Y to the install of the driver
7. reboot your Venus device

8. connect the RS485 adapter to your Venus / Raspberry Pi now.
### Hardware connection

Ad the moment the original cabel from the Epever doesnÂ´t work, because the driver do not work on my Raspberry pi.

So I make my own cabel and used this adapter:

If you want to use an other adapter you have to make shure that the service startet with your adapter.
